This repository demonstrates a common error in C++: invalidating iterators when modifying a vector. The `bug.cpp` file contains code that attempts to modify a vector's elements while iterating, leading to unpredictable results. The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version that avoids this issue.
